# ITE254---Human-Computer-Interaction.

This repository has  midterm project i.e. Spinn Coffee Maker interactive design and final project i.e. VR Headset interactive design that covers the majority of the topics studied throughout the course.

In this course, students are introduced to the fundamental theories and concepts of humancomputer interaction (HCI). HCI is an interdisciplinary field that integrates theories and methodologies across many domains including cognitive psychology, neurocognitive engineering, computer science, human factors, and engineering design. Students will gain theoretical knowledge of and practical experience in the fundamental aspects of human perception, cognition, and learning as relates to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interfaces. Topics covered include: interface design, usability evaluation, universal design, multimodal interfaces (touch, vision, natural language and 3-D audio), virtual reality, and spatial displays. In addition to lectures, students will work on individual and team assignments to design, implement, and evaluate various interactive systems and user interfaces based on knowledge culled from class material and additional research.
